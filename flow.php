"She said I'll throw myself away.
They're just photos after all.
I can't make you hang around.
I can't wash you off my skin.
Outside the frame, is what we're leaving out.
You won't remember anyway.
I can go with the flow.
But don't say it doesn't matter, matter anymore.
I can go with the flow.
Do you believe it in your head?
It's so safe to play along.
Little soldiers in a row.
Falling in and out of love.
Something sweet to throw away.
I want something good to die for.
To make it beautiful to live.
I want a new mistake, lose is more than hesitate.
Do you believe it in your head?
I can go with the flowâ€¦";
